# XSS Vulnerabilities Experiments with React Development

This is a repository to support my final thesis for the Bachelor of Computer Science at CESAR School.

## Laboratory

The laboratory was built using Docker, Docker Compose and JavaScript-based tools.

### Server

The server is written in Node.JS using `http` built-in module and official `mongodb` driver for node. It only maps routes to functions to receive and/or respond JSON. The database can be seeded by running `npm run seed` at the project's root.

### Infra

This folder holds MongoDB container files and a config js file.

### Frontend

The frontend is written in JSX using React. More information [here](/frontend/).

## Work

The final thesis can be read [TBD](/) in pt-BR.
